## Introduction

Xpose 4 is a collection of functions to be used as a model
building aid for nonlinear mixed-effects (population) analysis
using NONMEM. It facilitates data set checkout, exploration and
visualization, model diagnostics, candidate covariate identification
and model comparison.

## Installation

To install xpose you will need R (>= version 2.2.0). Download the latest version of R from http://www.r-project.org.  
To install Xpose in R use one of the following methods:

* latest stable release -- From CRAN.  Write at the R command line:

    ```{r standard-installation, eval = FALSE}
    install.packages("xpose4")
    ```
     
* Latest development version -- from Github. Note that the command below installs the "master" 
(development) branch; if you want the release branch from Github add `ref="release"` to the
`install_github()` call. 

    ```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
    # install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("UUPharmacometrics/xpose4")
    ```

## Running Xpose 4

Start R and load xpose:
```{r}
library(xpose4)
```


To use the classic menu system, type at the R command prompt:
```{r classic-menu,eval=FALSE}
xpose4()
```

Each function is independently available from the command
line, once the Xpose library is loaded. 

First we create a set of files from a NONMEM run
```{r,eval=FALSE}
cur.files <- dir() # current files in temp directory

simprazExample() # write files from an example NONMEM run
new.files <- dir()[!(dir() %in% cur.files)]  # the new files created by simprazExample
```

Then we can import our files to Xpose

```{r,eval=FALSE}
xpdb <- xpose.data(1) 
```


```{r,echo=FALSE}
xpdb <- simpraz.xpdb
```


Display goodness-of-fit plots:

```{r readme_example_figure_1}
  basic.gof(xpdb)
```

Clean up files that were created to show these examples:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
unlink(new.files)
```


More help is available in the online documentation, which can be found by
typing (for example) `?xpose4` at the R command line.  


## The Xpose 4 Bestiary

A more detailed description of Xpose with example plots and explanaitions for
most of the functions in the package is available in our Bestiarium:

## Don't Panic

Andrew Hooker (andrew.hooker at farmbio.uu.se)
should be able to get you an answer if you run into trouble.  The
website http://xpose.sf.net  should also be of help.


## Release Schedule

Bugfix releases will be released regularly, fixing any problems that are
found.
